The Egee.io Minecraft server is the oldest game server! Launched in 2016 as a private co-op/event server, it was later made public and has maintained almost 24/7 uptime ever since!

The Minecraft server follows the same rules as the rest of Egee.io, and includes these special rules:

* Do not pester the admins to release you from spawn - **read the book!**
* Do not deliberatly glitch, exploit, or try to lag/crash the server
* No stealing, griefing, or cheating (X-Ray, etc)

Since the Minecraft server is public, it is super easy to join!

Just enter: `minecraft.egee.io` into the "Server Address" when adding a new server.

The current roster of Minecraft admins are:

* mrj505
* Rice_Nice
* fuop

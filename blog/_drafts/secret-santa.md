## It's that time again üéÖ

Welcome to the 4th annual Egee.io Secret Santa event page!

### What's a Secret Santa

A "Secret Santa" is a person who gives someone a gift anonymously. In the Egee.io Secret Santa gift exchange, you are both gift-giver, and recipient!

### What are the rules

1. $10 max spending limit.
2. Keep it safe! (No IRL names, personal addresses, etc. Steam or Amazon wishlists only!)
3. Deliver your gift üéÅ by or before December 28th, 2019.
4. Have fun!

### Who can participate

For the first time ever the Egee.io Secret Santa gift exchange is open to every member of our Discord community regardless of longevity of membership, or the roles that you hold! The only restriction is that you must have been a member prior to December 1st, 2019!

### OMGZ UR TRYING TO GET MY PERSONAL INFORMATIONS

Nah. We don't want them! When you [sign up for the event](https://www.elfster.com/gift-exchanges/e6f246c4-71a8-4de8-aa43-e7b9fd83e93c/?join=ztzm), *don't use your real name*! Use your Steam handle or Discord moniker instead!

Whether chatting in Discord or playing on the Minecraft server, everyone should read and agree to the Egee.io Code of Conduct:

* The Discord server is diverse with lots of different channels for interests and discussions. It's normal for conversations to take minutes or hours between responses.

* Members are located in many countries across many timezones. Avoid asking people to respond to messages or mentioning (@) them in general.

* Members can assign roles to themselves based on their interests. Not everybody wants to partake in conversations about Linux or Furries; try to keep conversations to their respective channels.

* Being a community project, we love hearing ideas and feedback from the community. Don't be shy about ideas you may have to make the community better!

* If you or someone you know is in trouble, or you are concerned for their health or safety, please message Discord support. We do not have the resources to help people outside of the community boundaries. Itâ€™s important to pursue help from accredited professionals.

* We have a lot of patience for our members and giving the opportunity to understand and follow the rules & guidelines. However, when action must be taken, it usually results in a permanent ban from the community.

* We expect everyone to exercise restraint and grace when discussing topics they are passionate about or object to.

Our Code of Conduct is heavily inspired by the [Godot Code of Conduct](https://godotengine.org/code-of-conduct) and the [GNU Kind Communication](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.en.html) guidelines.

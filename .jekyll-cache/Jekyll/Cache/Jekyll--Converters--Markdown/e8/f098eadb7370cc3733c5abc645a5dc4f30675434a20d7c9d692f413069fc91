I"¹<p>The Egee.io <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/egee-io/">Minecraft server</a> is our oldest game server! It launched in 2016 as a private co-op/event server. It was made public and has maintained near 24/7 uptime ever since!</p>

<p>The Minecraft server follows the same rules as the rest of Egee.io, and includes these special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not pester the admins to release you from spawn - <strong>read the book!</strong></li>
  <li>Do not deliberately glitch, exploit, or try to lag/crash the server</li>
  <li>No stealing, griefing, or cheating (X-Ray, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the Minecraft server is public, it is super easy to join!</p>

<p>Just enter: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minecraft.egee.io</code> into the â€œ<em>Server Address</em>â€ when adding a new server.</p>

<p>The current roster of Minecraft admins are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mrj505</li>
  <li>Rice_Nice</li>
  <li>fuop</li>
</ul>

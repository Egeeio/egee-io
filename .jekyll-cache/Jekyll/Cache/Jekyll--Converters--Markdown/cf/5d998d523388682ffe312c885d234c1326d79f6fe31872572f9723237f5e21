I"<p>We host and manage our own dedicated game servers. Most are integrated into our Discord.</p>

<p>Our core game servers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/minecraft">Minecraft</a></li>
  <li><a href="/gmod">Garryâ€™s Mod</a></li>
  <li><a href="/rust">Rust</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of our core game servers have 99% uptime and are indexed in a central server browser or use DNS for joining.</p>

<p>For example, to join our Minecraft server, connect to: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minecraft.egee.io</code></p>

<p>We also occasionally host short-lived servers for games with new releases or renewed interest due to patches, mods, etc, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Terraria</li>
  <li>Starbound</li>
  <li>7 Days to Die</li>
  <li>SCP: Secret Laboratory</li>
</ul>

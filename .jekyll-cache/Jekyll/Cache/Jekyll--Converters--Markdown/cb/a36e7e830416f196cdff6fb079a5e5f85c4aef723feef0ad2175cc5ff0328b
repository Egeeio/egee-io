I"ç<p>The Rust server is a 24/7 casual solo/duo friendly server hosted on the West Coast of the US.</p>

<p>We occasionally wall-off portions of the map to host events and mini-games such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Murderer Escape &amp; Survive</li>
  <li>Capture the Flag</li>
  <li>Deer Hunt</li>
</ul>

<p>The Rust server follows the same rules as Egee.io, plus these additional guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Event spaces are clearly marked as such. They are for server-wide events, and harrassment of them is not cool and will not be tolerated.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t be toxic; Rust is an aggressive game. We encourage you to kill the player who lives two map-grids over!</li>
</ul>

<p>Please do not ruin it for everyone. Raid your neighbor instead!</p>

<p>Revenge-raid the group that raided you! Insult their build. Insult their aim. Donâ€™t insult them because of their gender, race, or sexual preference.</p>

<p>Since our Rust server is public, it is listed in the server browser under Community with Egee.io in the server title.</p>

<p>You can also join from the Rust console by running: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client.connect rust.egee.io:28015</code>.</p>

<p>The admin of the Rust server is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>penguinluff</li>
</ul>

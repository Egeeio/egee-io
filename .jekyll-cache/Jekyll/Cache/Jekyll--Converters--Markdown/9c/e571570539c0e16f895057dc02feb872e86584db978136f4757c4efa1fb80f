I"M<p>Our Garry’s Mod server is an event server that is up 24/7 to accomodate spontaneous random events!</p>

<p>Since it’s an event server, we use a Steam Workshop Collection and usually have the server configured to play a game mode instead of default sandbox mode.</p>

<p>The Garry’s Mod server is public and it should be listed in the server browser with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Egee.io</code> in the server title.</p>

<p>You can also join from the Gmod console by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect gmod.egee.io</code>.</p>

<p>Our collection of mods is very large (well over 1gb)! You should subscribe to it in Steam before trying to join the server.</p>

<p>The current admins of the Garry’s Mod server are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eg</li>
  <li>m00ch</li>
  <li>gordo</li>
</ul>

## It's that time again 🎅

Welcome to the 4th annual Egee.io Secret Santa event page!

### What's a Secret Santa

A "Secret Santa" is a person who gives someone a gift anonymously. In the Egee.io Secret Santa gift exchange, you are both gift-giver, and recipient!

### What are the rules

1. $10 max spending limit.
2. Keep it safe! (No IRL names, personal addresses, etc. Steam or Amazon wishlists only!)
3. Deliver your gift 🎁 by or before December 28th, 2019.
4. Have fun!

### Who can participate

Anyone with the **Heroes** role in [Discord](https://discord.gg/EMbcgR8). Folks without the Heroes role are not eligible for participation at this time, though that may change as things evolve! 😄

### OMGZ UR TRYING TO GET MY PERSONAL INFORMATIONS

Nah. We don't want them! When you sign up for the event, *don't use your real name*! Use your Steam handle or Discord moniker instead!

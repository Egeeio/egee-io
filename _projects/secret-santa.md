## Omfg. It's that time again 🎅

Welcome to the 4th annual Egee.io Secret Santa event page!

A "Secret Santa" is a person who gives someone a gift anonymously. In the Egee.io Secret Santa gift exchange, you are both gift-giver, and recipient!

### What are the rules

1. $15 max spending limit.
2. Keep it safe! (No IRL names, personal addresses, etc. Steam or Amazon wishlists only.)
3. Deliver your gift 🎁 by or before the due date, which is December 28th, 2018.
4. Have fun!

### Who can participate

Anyone with a "Heroes" role. Folks without the Heroes role (or above) are not eligible for participation at this time, though that may change as future events evolve 😄

### OMGZ UR TRYING TO GET MY PERSONAL INFORMATIONS

We aren't! We don't want them! When you sign up for the event, don't use your real name; use your Steam handle or Discord moniker instead!

## Our Community

Originally started as a Discord server for fans of Egee's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/egeeplays), the Egee.io community grew a life of its own with active community members from all over the world.

Most of the Egee.io community admins are located in the Pacific Northwest and attend conventions such as the Portland Gaming Expo as a group!

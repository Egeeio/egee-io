## Dedicated Game Servers

Like any self-respecting gaming community, Egee.io hosts several dedicated game servers.

All of our servers run in [Linode](https://promo.linode.com/egee/), a VPS (virtual private server) provider and most of them have 99% up time. Each server is managed through our purpose-built server manager tool [gsd-cli](/project/gsd-cli).

**All servers have the following rules:**

- Use common sense: don't cheat or hack.
- No spamming or advertising in chat.
- Do not harass the Admins or ask/imply for items, kill logs, etc.

## How To Join

Most servers have use DNS and are plugged into a central server listing (Rust, Gmod, etc).

Other servers require you to connect directly to the server via a server browser (Minecraft, SCP).

If you are having trouble finding or connecting to a server, message an admin on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/EMbcgR8) server.

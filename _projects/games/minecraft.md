The Egee.io Minecraft server is a regular un-modded server running the latest version and is moderated by Striped_Monkey.

The Minecraft server a survival server with PvP enabled, however mob griefing is disabled so buildings are free from creeper explosions!
The server runs on Spigot (a fork of Bukkit) which helps with logging and griefer protection.

While the server is typically free of problems (griefers, lag, crashes, unexpected deaths, etc), if issues do arise, please to report them
on the [Egee.io Discord](https://discord.gg/EMbcgR8) via the Minecraft channel, or to Striped_Monkey directly. If you are unable to access the server at all, feel free to Tweet at Egee himself.

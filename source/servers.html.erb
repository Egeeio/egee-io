    <h4>The Rust Server (Currently Up)</h4>
    <p>
      Our Rust server is a vanilla low-pop Rust server. We‚Äôre generally a pretty chill server but PvP &amp; raids and murders happen. This is Rust after all.
      But don‚Äôt let that keep you from building and exploring. Most of us are pretty nice üòä.
    </p>
    <p>
      The server follows a monthly wipe cycle set which usually happens on the first Thursday of each month. Regular wipes help keep things interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      We typically host raid, zambie hunt, or attack helicopter events on the last day before the wipe. If you want to participate, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/unQ5wxv">Discord server</a> and ask about events in the #rust channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can connect to the Rust server:<br>
      &#8226; Start Rust<br>
      &#8226; From the main menu, click the "Play Game" icon<br>
      &#8226; Click the "Community" section and look for the word <i>Egee</i>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can connect to it directly by opening the Rust console (F1) and typing <b>client.connect server.egee.io:28015</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Official Rules:<br>
      1) Use common sense. Admins are not going to explain the rules to everyone.<br>
      2) No hate speech or verbal attacks towards players.<br>
      3) Event areas are off limits unless in use. If you are unsure if an area is Event related, ask somebody.<br>
      4) The server tends to be pretty chill but PvP can and will happen. Avoid raiding twig bases, and it is generally uncool to begin full-scale raiding less than 1 week into the wipe.<br>
      5) Raiding will occur but griefing will not. This includes but is not limited to foundation wiping, tool cupboard/door locking, placing traps & turrets around sleepers, and eliminating beds (offline raids).<br>
      6) Do not harass the Admins or ask/imply for items, kill logs, or anything else.<br>

    <h4>The Vanilla Minecraft Server (Currently Up)</h4>
    <p>
      Our Minecraft server a low-pop survival server with mob griefing is disabled (buildings are safe from creeper explosions!).
      The server runs on Spigot (a fork of Bukkit) which helps with logging and griefer protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Server rules are simple:<br>
      1. Don't grief.<br>
      2. Don't steal.<br>
      3. Don't be an asshat.
    </p>

    <h4>The Team Fortress 2 Server (On-Demand)</h4>
    <p>
      Our Team Fortress 2 server is typically an event-only style server but occasionally you can find it running and listed in the community servers section of TF2 or the Steam server browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a standard Vanilla Team Fortress 2 server except that there are 6 bots, one bot leaves for each player joined (there are no bots playing after 6 players join).
      The server is fun to play on with groups of folks from the Egee.io or community or if you just want to practice with the bots.

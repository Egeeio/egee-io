We host & manage our own game servers and most are integrated into our Discord server.

Our core dedicated game servers are:

* Minecraft
* Garry's Mod
* Rust

All of our core game servers have 99% uptime and are indexed in a central server browser or uses DNS for joining.

For example, to join our Minecraft server, connect to: `minecraft.egee.io`

We also occasionally host short-lived game servers for games with new releases or renewed interested due to patches, mods, etc, such as for:

* Terraria
* Starbound
* 7 Days to Die
* SCP: Secret Laboratory

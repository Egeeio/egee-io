## An Abridged Review

Let's take a quick look at a Free & Open Source game called [OpenClonk](https://www.openclonk.org/). I actually reviewed this last year on the Egee Tech channel but I'm re-uploading that video to the Egee Gaming channel.

This review is *abridged* because writing a game review is actually pretty time consuming and I've already reviewed OpenClonk in the video. My feelings about the game haven't changed so I'll just be summarizing them here.

## What Is It?

> OpenClonk is a sandbox game with action, adventure, building, and puzzle elements thrown in.

OpenClonk is an Open Source project which continues the development & spirit of the [Clonk](http://www.clonk.de/index.php?lng=en) series of games, which got started in 1994 as shareware games by RedWolf design.

[OpenClonk](https://wiki.openclonk.org/w/About) was started sometime after the release of Clonk Rage in 2009. The Clonk engine was released under the ISC Open Source license after the lead developer announced he didn't have any time to work on Clonk anymore.

At its core, OpenClonk is more-or-less a sandbox game with action, adventure, building, and puzzle elements thrown in. OpenClonk is game with tremendous depth and endless replay value simply because of *what* it is.

## Is It Any Good?

It is! Because of the sheer amount of depth the game has, I think OpenClonk can appeal to everyone, especially those familiar with games like Terraria or Minecraft.

There's single-player challenges & scenarios as well as multi-player modes reminiscent of a real-time [Worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(series)) battle.

## Should You Play It?

> OpenClonk feels & plays like something you'd find on the Steam Store.

Absolutely. If nothing else, OpenClonk is a curious game because of how well polished it is for being a truly Open Source game.

Let's be real here - many Open Source games lack that *special something* found in commercial games; you *know* its an Open Source game just from the art style or controls.

OpenClonk doesn't feel like a "free" or "cheap" game at all. It feels and plays like something you'd find on the Steam Store.

And if you use Linux, OpenClonk is most likely in your software repositories right now! The latest version of OpenClock is also available from [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.openclonk.OpenClonk).

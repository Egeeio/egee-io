## It's About Time üéâ

If you've lurked around our Discord server, you'll probably know that I've been talking about the Egee.io website for looong time. Well folks, the new site is finally here! ü•≥

But most importantly, there's an official blog now, too!

The [Medium](https://medium.com/@egee_irl/) page is being repurposed to be more _targeted_ towards coders and programming in general, which works better with Medium's platform and article discovery model.

I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@egee_irl/thoughts-on-the-future-of-medium-57c81d8bd218) on Medium about my thoughts on the future of the platform and my feelings are the same. Medium **is** a good platform for some things.

## What's To Come

The original Egee.io website was a [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog. And before that, it was a Wordpress blog (*under a different name*).

Look forward to the Distro Delves series making an appearance here on the blog, as well as some other series were originally meant as YouTube videos but will be written as blog posts instead.

I'm excited about returning to that simpler time when I spent less time making videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Egeeirl) and wrote blog posts and played video games.

Making videos for the [Distro Delves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGHiAlif1EhnNQozcSwu2ZSt7oDWaX0J) series has shown me that there's a very limited amount of information that I can pack into a 10 minute YouTube video. A lot of interesting things get cut from the videos due to time constraints.

## Perpetual Construction

I've waffled about whether the website should be a "landing site" for the community and whether it should have a blog attached to it at all.

I have also spent way too much time considering what language & framework the website should be written in. This indirectly caused a half-dozen rewrites which basically produced nothing.

I forced myself to just _finish_ the website by the end of November 2019. And I'm happy with the site but there are *always* improvements to be made. üõ†Ô∏è

The current iteration of the website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses styling heavily inspired by [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Cirrus](https://spiderpig86.github.io/Cirrus/).

## How To Support The Site

Currently, I run Egee.io at a *deficit*. Simply put, **it costs me** more money to operate our game servers & website than I receive from ads, donations, and partnerships.

## Escape To Dishong Tower

I've had a 7 Days to Die series on my mind for [quite some time](https://youtu.be/J3CWDcf4iLI) and I think the Egee Gaming channel is in a good place to finally start one!

We're starting things off with a bang - a survival challenge in [Dishong Tower](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Dishong_Tower).

We'll be filming this series on the [Egee.io](https://egee.io/project/game-servers) 7 Days to Die server, and I'll will be playing the game on Linux, specifically [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io/).

## Series Goal

Myself and *one* other survivor are going to try our very best to stay alive in the crumbling Dishong Tower for as long as we can.

Obviously, we're destined to die, but the point of the series is to see how long we last.

Furthermore, I'm not particularly good at this game so there's a chance we won't even make it to day 7. ðŸ˜‚

## Series Rules

Since this series is a **challenge** of sorts, there are a couple of house rules:

- Default difficulty, zombie spawns, etc
- Day 1 is traveling to the tower & collecting things on the way
- Once we enter the tower, **we cannot leave!**
- No exploits! (nerd polling, wood-frames in doorways, etc)
- Perma-Death! (no respawns)

The series ends when *one of us* dies. ðŸ’€

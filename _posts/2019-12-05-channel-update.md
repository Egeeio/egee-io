## 2019 tl;dr

It has been a rough year for the channel. ðŸ¤•

Google made a _ton_ of updates to YouTube throughout the year and the channel was hit really hard.

The picture above is analytics for the most popular video on the channel to date. And you can see there was a big algorithm change in late 2018 which devastated traffic to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oKLbAXgm7A) and others on the channel.

> Google may have changed how the algorithm ranks Likes/Dislikes

Unfortunately, I didn't even realize this had happened until October after I got laid off from my job at the time.

## What Happened?

Nobody knows for sure how the YouTube algorithm works. I'm _guessing_ that Google changed how the algorithm ranks Likes/Dislikes because that's the only major "detractor" for that particular video.

Videos on my channel get a somewhat unusual amount of dislikes. Sometimes, I'll upload a video and _within minutes_ receive a dislike or two on it. It's been this way for years and I know several other Linux YouTubers that have/had the same problem.

This and other videos that suffered the same fate have similar like/dislike ratios.

## Moving Forward

To be fair, I haven't been super happy with the content on channel. I got really burned out working at my previous gig that I stopped thinking about the "next best video" for the channel, and the whole creative process of making a video felt like a grind.

I've been thinking of changing things up on the channel for a while but didn't have the motivation to make anything happen until I got laid off. And, after I saw the analytics, I knew something had to change.

## A New Format

> Having a coherent series allows me to focus and plan for videos

If you follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/egee_irl) or have been on the channel lately, you've probably seen something about the new "[Distro Delves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTGHiAlif1EhnNQozcSwu2ZSt7oDWaX0J)" series. I wrote an article about Distro Delves on [Medium](https://medium.com/@egee_irl/new-series-distro-delves-ce44dcc0124d) but I need to re-write it for season 2 here on the website.

Instead of churning out seemingly random videos weekly, the channel is switching to an episodic format with series' like Distro Delves. There's another series in the works called Brunchmark but I haven't finished writing the outline for it yet.

Having a coherent series allows me to focus and **plan** for specific types of videos, such as a Linux distro review or a Desktop Environment comparison video, which leads to much better quality content!

## What about the older videos?

I've organized *all* the videos on the channel into [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/Egeeirl/playlists) according to the new series.

Lots of older videos with exceptionally poor like/dislike ratios & viewership have been removed from the channel and placed into the "archive".

Fans & folks interested in seeing the old videos can pledge on Patreon or support me on Ko-fi and get access to the **over 50** archived videos that were delisted from the channel.

## Thank You! ðŸš€

## Pingus - The FOSS Lemmings Clone

Let's have a quick look at a Free & Open Source game called [Pingus](https://pingus.seul.org/). This is another game I reviewed last year on the Egee channel but I'm re-uploading that video to the Egee.io channel.

Like the reviews before it, this one is *abridged* because writing a game review is actually pretty time consuming and I've already reviewed it in the video.

## What Is It?

> Pingus is a free Lemmings-like puzzle game

Pingus was written in 1998 by German developer Ingo Ruhnke with the intent to create a FOSS [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)) clone. It's basically Lemmings but with Penguins instead of [lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemming).

If you've played Lemmings before, Pingus is practically the same thing. It's a puzzle game where you have to lead a group of _things_ (lemmings, penguins, etc) from an entrance to an exit whilst avoiding traps and other dangerous obstacles.

## Is It Any Good?

If you like puzzle games, sure.

> I did enjoy playing some of the early levels

The original Lemmings game is widely considered a classic and was ported to _pretty much_ every OS platform during its heyday in 1991 to 1994.

Personally, I don't particularly like these games. I find them to be tedious at best, and frustrating at worse. But I'm not a fan of puzzle games.

I'll admit that I did enjoy playing some of the early levels that did not have a ton of twists and deadly traps.

## Should You Play It?

Pingus is yet another FOSS classic and an original native Linux game to boot. It's available in pretty much every Linux distribution's standard repositories, and available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.seul.pingus), too.

It's also one of the first _native_ Linux games, being released in 1998 using Clanlib before SDL was a mainstream thing. Based on that, I'd say that anybody that claims to "Game on Linux" could give Pingus a try at least once.

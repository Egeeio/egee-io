## Start of a New Series

I've been talking about Brunchmarks for a couple of months but I've had ideas of benchmarking & comparison videos for quite some time.

After I did my KDE vs XFCE video, I wanted to tackle more desktop environments but these videos are really time-consuming to make. And let's be honest here - that KDE vs XFCE video wasn't very good.

> I've had my mind on a new benchmark/comparison series for years

Brunchmarks is the spiritual successor to *that* video and others like it!

## Pilot Episode

I'm calling the video **Episode 0** because it's not meant to be a pilot episode. I'm still tweaking the format but the final outline will *probably* be about the same.

I haven't decided on what the *actual* pilot episode will be but I'm considering re-making that KDE vs XFCE video because a new XFCE version was released since I produced that video and people ask about it in the comments section all the time.

There's a _behind the scenes_ post about this episode that you can read on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/32505674) or [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/post/Brunchmarks---Behind-The-Scenes-Episode-0-V7V11AQJ1).

## Sponsorship

The folks at NordPass contacted me in November about getting a spot on an upcoming video for December. I'm super picky about who I work with and feature in my videos but I actually already use NordVPN so I was happy that they reached out.

> I try to keep the sponsorships relevant to the content of the video

I thought it fit the video because elementaryOS is a desktop Linux distribution for regular users but also privacy-minded.

I don't plan to have sponsors for every or even most videos, but I try to keep the sponsorships relevant to the content of the video without being too distracting.

We're an online community where people are free to be who and what they want to be!

Founded in 2016, our community is dedicated to fostering a creative & open space for everyone to express and be themselves! 

We have a Discord server with active members from all over the world. We host our own dedicated game servers and organize regular activities such as game nights, holiday events, and movie nights!

Every member of the Egee.io, whether on Discord or playing on our game servers, is expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](/codeofconduct) and following rules:

* Respect preferences & pronouns.
* Keep criticism constructive.
* Assume the best in others.
* No offensive speech, bigotry, or trolling.
* No obsene or NSFW/NSFL language or posts.
* Do not discuss or post illegal topics (including piracy).

## Game Servers

We self-host and manage our own dedicated game servers and make them public for everyone to enjoy.

The current roster of servers includes:

* [Minecraft](/minecraft)
* [Garry's Mod](/gmod)
* [Rust](/rust)

You can usually find our servers in game server browsers or connect directly like `minecraft.egee.io` or `gmod.egee.io`.

## Discord

In addition to the Discord [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and [guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), we have the following community rules:

* @ roles with care.
* Report issues to admins (demigod role).
* Avoid divisive or controversial topics in public channels.
* #general is rated PG. Assume other channels are PG-13.
* Absolutely no OS/Linux evangelism.

Launched in 2016, our community is dedicated to fostering a creative & open space for everyone to express and be themselves!

We have a [Discord](/discord) server with active members from all over the world. We host our own dedicated game servers and organize regular activities such as game nights, holiday events, and movie nights!

The Discord server and all of our game servers have the same set of simple rules:

* Be decent; absolutely no hate speech or bigotry.
* Don't be malicious; no hacking, exploiting, or cheating.
* Do not spam or advertise without permission.
* Do not demand items, kill logs, etc from admins.

Much of Egee.io is Open Source! You can find the source code for this website, our bots, and parts of the infrastructure on [Github](https://github.com/Egeeio)!

We host and manage our own dedicated game servers. Most are integrated into our Discord.

Our core game servers are:

* [Minecraft](/minecraft)
* [Rust](/rust)

All of our core game servers have 99% uptime and are indexed in a central server browser or use DNS for joining.

For example, to join our Minecraft server, connect to: `minecraft.egee.io`

We also occasionally host short-lived servers for games with new releases or renewed interest due to patches, mods, etc, such as:

* [Garry's Mod](/gmod)
* 7 Days to Die
* Starbound
* Terraria
* SCP: Secret Laboratory

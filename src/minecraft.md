The Egee.io Minecraft server launched in 2016 as a co-op/event server for [Egee's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/ogegee). It's now a whitelist server with plugins that is available for all Egee.ioers to enjoy.

The Minecraft server follows the same rules as the rest of Egee.io, and includes these special rules:

* Do not deliberately glitch, exploit, or try to lag/crash the server
* No stealing, griefing, or cheating (X-Ray, etc)

The Minecraft server used to be public but now it's a whitelisted server so you'll need to ask an admin to add you. Just join the [Egee.io Discord](https://egee.io/discord) and ask in the *#minecraft* channel!

To join our server, add or direct connect to: `minecraft.egee.io`.

The current roster of Minecraft admins are:

* fuop
* Rice_Nice

The Rust server is a 24/7 small-group friendly server hosted on the West Coast of the US.

Our Rust server is public so you can find it listed in the community server browser! You can also join from the Rust console by running: `client.connect rust.egee.io:28015`

### Rules

The Rust server follows the same rules as the rest of Egee.io, plus these additional guidelines:

**1.** No racism, sexism, homophobia, or other language intended to insult someone based on any qualities outside of their game-play. Players who violate this rule will receive **one warning**, after which they will be permanently banned from playing on any Egee.io servers.

**2.** This is n00b friendly. Don't be a jerk.

**3.** No griefing. Griefing includes *(but is not limited to)* intentionally despawning loot from raided bases, locking someone out of a base that you do not intend to occupy, and trapping a base or a sleeper. We reserve the right to make judgement calls about griefing on a case-to-case basis.

The admin(s) of the Rust server are:

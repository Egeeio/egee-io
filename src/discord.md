The Discord server is like a nexus for the community. We host game servers, virtual events, and occasionally attend local conventions together!

We're an inclusive community variety server and welcome everyone!

In addition to the Discord [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and [guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), we have the following community rules:

* Respect preferences & pronouns.
* No offensive speech, bigotry, or trolling.
* No obsene or NSFW/NSFL posts.
* Do not derail topics or filibuster.
* Do not discuss or post illegal topics (including piracy).

And some Discord-specific rules:

* @ roles with care.
* Report issues to admins (_demigod role_).
* Avoid media posts in #general.
* #general is rated PG. Assume other channels are PG-13.
* Keep conversation topics in their respective channels.

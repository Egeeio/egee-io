The Rust server is a 24/7 small-group friendly server hosted on the West Coast of the US.

The Rust server follows the same rules as Egee.io, plus these additional guidelines:

1) No racism, sexism, homophobia, or other language intended to insult someone based on any qualities outside of their game-play. Players who violate this rule will recieve one warning, after which they will be permanently banned from playing on any Egee.io servers. 
2) This is n00b friendly. Don't be a jerk.
3) No griefing. Griefing includes (but is not limited to) intentionally despawning loot from raided bases, locking someone out of a base that you do not intend to occupy, and trapping a base or a sleeper. We reserve the right to make judgement calls about griefing on a case-to-case basis. 
4) You may have up to 4 players on your team. Teams can have friendly interactions with other groups, but cannot roam or raid together. Teams can do large and small oil rig, cargo ship, and venom/bradley events with other teams. 

Since our Rust server is public, it is listed in the community server browser!
You can also join from the Rust console by running: `client.connect rust.egee.io:28015`.

The admins of the Rust server are:

The Rust server is a casual solo/duo friendly server that is up 24/7 to accomodate spontaneous random events!

Since it's an event server, we use large Steam Workshop Collection and usually have it configured to play a game mode instead of default sandbox mode.

Since our Rust server is public, it is listed in the server browser under _Community_ with `Egee.io` in the server title.

You can also join from the Rust console by running `client.connect rust.egee.io:28015`.

The admin of the Rust server is:

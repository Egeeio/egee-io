      What's a Secret Santa?
    </h2>
    <p class="has-text-white-bis">
      It's basically this annual event where people sign up on a website called Elfster and send <i>things</i> to each
      other. The "secret" part is that the person reciving the gift doesn't know who it's from until they receive it.

    </h2>
    <p class="has-text-white-bis">
      When you sign up for Elfster, <b>don't</b> use your real name; use your Discord handle instead. And if you aren't
      comfortable using your personal address, see if you can use a PO Box or a different address. If that isn't an
      option, don't participate ðŸ˜¢

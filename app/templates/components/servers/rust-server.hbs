            Our Rust server is a vanilla server and can be found in the "Community" section of the server browser and currently supports up to 10 players. It gets completely wiped (including BP's) roughly once a month.

            Expect to see Rust newbies on this server so don't expect any major PvP. You can view the game map <a href="http://map.playrust.io/?Procedural%20Map_2400_985693974#Egee.io%20Rust%20Server%20%7C%20Powered%20By%20Ubuntu%2016.04%20(173.241.174.182%3A28015)">here</a>.

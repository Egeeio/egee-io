          <p>
            The Linux Gamer (TLG for short) runs a YouTube channel dedicated to Linux gaming and humor. He's been a Linux user since nigh-on seven years and has participated in many open source communities since that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's TLG's vision to foster growth and kinship among members of the Egee.io community.
          </p>
          <p>
            TLG loves nerd culture, prosumer technology, cartoons, music, and philosophy. In real life, his family and friends call him 'Gardiner.'

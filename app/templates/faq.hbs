          <p class="black-text">
            Before Valve released Steam for Linux in 2013, there were a handful of AAA games for Linux. Since Steam’s launch on the platform, the number of games has skyrocketed.
            While not every Windows game in your Steam library will work, chances are about a quarter of them have Linux/SteamOS support (and that’s nothing to disparage).

          It’s true that learning and adapting to any unfamiliar interface can be daunting. With perseverance you may find as others have that Linux has the best user paradigm.
          Not to mention, many of your daily computing tasks can be automated or made easier with the terminal.

            Ever wonder what nefarious bits are hidden inside Windows 10’s End-user License Agreement?

             Open Source software come with permissive licenses that respect your freedom and your privacy.

        <p class="black-text">
          Several years ago, there were lots of gaps in hardware support in Linux distributions.
          These days, you'd be hardpressed to find a new PC or laptop that wasn't fully supported by your favorite Linux distribution.
          This is due in large part to <b>open</b> standards, especially when it comes to printers, scanners, digital camera, and Wireless adapters.
          That being said, if you had a modem from 1997, it may not work on Linux. But on the other hand, it probably wouldn't work on Windows 10, either.

			The Egee.io community home is on Discord. Discord is a low-latency messaging platform similar to IRC or Mumble but specifically designed with gaming communities in mind. All news and updates about the Egee.io game servers, live streams, or game nights are posted on Discord.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are chat channels for each topic on the Egee.io Discord and the community is moderated to prevent spam. We also have several voice channels that make gaming and collaborating together a whole lot easier.
		</p>
		<p>
			Egee.io also has a Steam group with a forum for people to interact with the community outside of Discord.

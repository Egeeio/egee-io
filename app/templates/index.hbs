            Egee.io is proudly self-hosted and powered supported by open source technologies. We don't use <u>any</u> hosting providers or platforms.
            This allows us to remain in control of our software choices and firmly commit to using &amp; supporting open source technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly every Egee.io asset operates from within a Docker container. From the game servers, to our Discord bot, even this website; everything is running inside of Docker containers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Egee.io website is built with EmberJS &amp; a dash of JQuery. All of our game servers are powered by <a href="https://github.com/egee-irl/gsc-docs">Game Server Containers</a>. You can read more about the software we use <a href="https://github.com/egee-irl/egeeio">here</a>.

              It takes a huge amount of time and effort to maintain all of the Egee.io game servers and services so that they can remain self-hosted.
              Not to mention that Egee himself is the sole contributor to 90% of all the projects that power Egee.io.
            </p>
            <p>
              Egee.io will <u>never</u> become an ad-based or pay-wall driven platform. Instead, Egee.io is powered by contributions and donations made by the community.

    <h4 class="center">Egee.io Community Rules!</h4>
    <p>
       Egee.io is a place where gamers of <i>any</i> platform can hangout, meet and game with other gamers, and talk about other things of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a few rules that apply to both the Discord server &#38; our game servers:
      <br>
      • Don't be a dick to other community members (this includes platform shaming).
      <br>      
      • Don't shitpost or post NSFW material.
    </p>
    <h5>Game Servers</h5>
    <p>
      For our game servers, we have one golden rule:<br>
      • Don't hack, exploit, or glitch. Really, it's not that hard to play fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that you encounter an issue on the server (outages, severe lag, hackers, etc), let us know!
    </p>
    <h5>Discord Server</h5>
    <p>
      Our Discord server is moderated by community members and we have a short list of rules to help keep order:<br>
      1) New community members cannot post links or attachments until they are a day old
      <br>
      2) Try and keep discussions in the channels they pertain to (troubleshooting in #troubleshooting, gaming in #games, etc).
      <br>
      3) If you are discussing a topic in one of the voice channels, use #voice-general for text to avoid accidentally spamming other text channels

    <h4>The Egee.io Low-Pop Rust Server!</h4>
    <p>
      Our Rust server is a vanilla (un-modded) low-pop Rust server. Since it's a low-population server, many of the denizens are friendly and play to build, explore, and generally hangout.
      But don't get too upset if you wake up in-game to find out you were murdered by your <i>friends</i>. This is Rust after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Rust server follows the official wipe cycle set by Facepunch (the same cycle that official servers follow) which usually happens on the first Thursday of each month.
    </p>
    <p>
      We typically host big raid, melee, or attack helicopter events on the last day before the wipe. If you want to participate, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/unQ5wxv">Discord server</a> and ask about events in the #rust channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can connect to the Rust server:<br>
      &#8226; Start Rust<br>
      &#8226; From the main menu, click the "Play Game" icon<br>
      &#8226; Click the "Community" section and look for <i>Egee.io | Low Pop | PNW | Linux</i>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>

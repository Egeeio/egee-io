              Egee.io uses Linux containers to host game servers which makes it quick and easy to host new game servers on demand.
              Most of our servers are ephemeral but we do maintain a small number of persistent game servers.

    <h4 class="center">Egee.io Community Rules!</h4>
    <p>
       Egee.io is a place where gamers of <i>any</i> platform can hangout, meet and game with other gamers, and talk about other things of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a few rules that apply to both the Discord server &#38; our game servers:
      <br>
      • Don't be a dick to other community members (this includes platform shaming).
      <br>      
      • Don't shitpost or post NSFW material.
    </p>
    <h5>Game Servers</h5>
    <p>
      For our game servers, we have one golden rule:<br>
      • Don't hack, exploit, or glitch. Really, it's not that hard to play fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that you encounter an issue on the server (outages, severe lag, hackers, etc), let us know!
    </p>
    <h5>Discord Server</h5>
    <p>
      Our Discord server is moderated by community members and we have a short list of rules to help keep order:<br>
      1) New community members cannot post links or attachments until they are a day old
      <br>
      2) Try and keep discussions in the channels they pertain to (troubleshooting in #troubleshooting, gaming in #games, etc).
      <br>
      3) If you are discussing a topic in one of the voice channels, use #voice-general for text to avoid accidentally spamming other text channels

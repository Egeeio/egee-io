            The Egee.io Linux gaming community currently hosts and maintains two persistant game servers with guaranteed up-time.
            Both game servers are hosted on a physical machines premise running Ubuntu 16.04 with a gigabit ethernet connection.
          </p>
          <p class="black-text">
            New game servers can be created at the request of the community and for events, such as Prop Hunt in Gary's Mod.
            These particular servers are short-lived and don't affect the other servers we run.
          </p>

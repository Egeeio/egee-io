        The offical Egee.io Minecraft server is a regular un-modded server running version 1.10.x and is moderated by Egee.io community member <i>Striped_Monkey</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Minecraft server a survival server with PvP enabled, however mob griefing is disabled so buildings are free from creeper explosions! 
        The server runs on Spigot (a fork of Bukkit) which helps with logging and griefer protection.

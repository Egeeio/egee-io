        GhostSquad57 from the Egee.io community runs a Quakeworld server over at ghostsquad57.com:28501
      </p>
      <p>
        The recommended client for joining the server is <a href="http://nquake.com/">nQuake</a>  which runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. 
        Any Quakeworld compatible client should connect to the server without any issues, but nQuake is <b>strongly</b> recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Hardware: the server uses an Intel i5-3550 at 3.3GHz and 16GBs of Ballistix Sport UDIMM Memory. For storage, the server uses a 250GB Samsung EVO SSD. The server is also equipped with an Intel Pro/1000 Dual Gigabit LAN NIC.<br>
        • Software used to host the server: the server uses the Quakeworld client nQuakesv<br>
        • Mods: the server uses KTX and QWFWD<br>
        • Uptime: varies; usually %80 uptime<br>
        • Gamemode: Free-For-All (FFA)<br>
        • Maps: The map rotation currently consists of dm4, dm6, hate, head-shot, efdm10, and genocide<br>
        • Maxplayers: currently the maxplayers is set to 8<br>

        Contacting:<br>
        If you think a different gamemode would be better, or maybe you think the maxplayers should be higher, 
        contact me on the <a href="/#discord">Egee.io Discord</a> and I'll be glad to make the changes.<br>

        GhostSquad57 from the Egee.io community runs a Quake 2 server over at ghostsquad57.com:28501
      </p>
      <p>
        The recommended client for joining the server is <a href="https://www.yamagi.org/quake2/">Yamagi Quake 2</a>  which runs on Linux, Mac OS X, BSD (FreeBSD and OpenBSD) and Windows. 
        Any Quake 2 source port should connect to the server without any issues, but Yamagi Quake 2 is <b>strongly</b> recommended.
      </p>

        If you think a different gamemode would be better, or maybe you think the maxplayers should be higher, 
        contact me on the <a href="/#discord">Egee.io Discord</a> and I'll be glad to make the changes.<br>

          <p>
            Because Rust isn't totally supported on Linux, we do not maintain a full-time server with guaranteed up-time.
            However, we do run a Rust server at the request of members of the community. Either join the Discord chat and if the Rust server is up or not or simply enter client.connect 173.241.174.182:28015 into the Rust terminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that Rust is an early-access game and Facepunch (the developers) have a very strict "server wipe" schedule. Don't expect your characters or structures to stay around forever.

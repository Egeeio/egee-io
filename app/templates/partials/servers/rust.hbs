            The Egee.io Rust server has the lowest population of all of the persistent Egee.io servers which makes it a fantastic server to learn how to play Rust on. 
            Typically the denizens of the server are non-violent but don't mistake this server as a friendly "no-kill" server: PvP is still very much alive on the server.
          </p>
          <p>
	    The Rust server is a vanilla non-modded server so you can easily find it in the server browser by simply searching for "Egee".

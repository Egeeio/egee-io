          <p>
            Our Minecraft server is an un-modded server running version 1.9.4 and can support up to 20 concurrent players. You can connect to it by simply typing <i>Egee.io</i> into the server address.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a survival server but we expect people to play friendly. The sever is typically free of problems (griefers, lag, unexpected deaths, etc) but if issues do arise, feel free to report them in the Facebook page or Steam group.

      <p>He has a deviant art account, tumblr, and infrequently streams art on picarto.tv. He has plans to become more active in streaming and start a youtube channel once he can buy some new hardware that can handle it.</p>

        Our Terraria server runs vanilla (un-modded) server version 1.3.1 and is moderated by Egee.io community member <i>Omegapex</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Terraria server is a standard softcore server and uses TShock so that if any issues DO arise, it would be relatively easy to pin point and fix.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the server is typically free of problems (griefers, lag, crashes, unexpected deaths, etc), if issues do arise, please to report them 
        on the <a href="/#discord">Egee.io Discord</a> via the Terraria channel, or to Omegapex directly. If you are unable to access the server at all, feel free to Tweet at Egee himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Connecting to the Egee.io Terraria server is simple:<br>
        &#8226; Fire up Terraria<br>
        &#8226; From the main menu, click "Multiplayer"<br>
        &#8226; From the "Multiplayer" screen, click "Join via IP"<br>
        &#8226; Enter Egee.io as the server address once you have chosen (or created) a character<br>
        &#8226; Server port is default (7777)<br>       
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's it!
      </p>

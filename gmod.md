Our Garry's Mod server is a purpose-built event server to accomodate spontaneous random events!

Since it's an event server, we use a Steam Workshop Collection and the server is usually configured to play a game mode instead of default sandbox mode.

The Garry's Mod server is public and it should be listed in the server browser with `Egee.io` in the server title.

You can also join from the Gmod console by running `connect gmod.egee.io`.

Our collection of mods is very large (well over 1gb)! You should [subscribe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1270037458) to it **before** trying to join the server!

The current admins of the Garry's Mod server are:

* Eg
* m00ch
* gordo

Our Garry's Mod server is an event server that is up 24/7 to accomodate spontaneous random events!

Since it's an event server, we use a Steam Workshop Collection and usually have the server configured to play a game mode instead of default sandbox mode.

The Garry's Mod server is public and it should be listed in the server browser with `Egee.io` in the server title.

You can also join from the Gmod console by running `connect gmod.egee.io`.

Our collection of mods is very large (well over 1gb)! You should subscribe to it in Steam before trying to join the server.

The current admins of the Garry's Mod server are:

* Eg
* m00ch
* gordo
